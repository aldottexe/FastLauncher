# Fast Launcher
### An Android app by Alex Lutz



This is my final project CIS-1051.
I'm really bad at organizing my phone homescreen, so it usually takes me a good 10-30 seconds to open an app I'm looking for (which is unacceptable).
I wanted to create an app that not only forced me to organize my phone, but also allowed me to launch apps faster than ever before.

I created this app using Java and XML in Android Studio -- which took care of generating all of the necessary config files.
This project was created almost entirely from included Android Libraries, with the exception being the [blurkit](https://github.com/CameraKit/blurkit-android/blob/master/blurkit/src/main/java/io/alterac/blurkit/BlurKit.java) library by Alterac. I used blurkit to apply the blur effect behind the homescreen tiles.

I followed [this](https://www.androidauthority.com/make-a-custom-android-launcher-837342-837342/) tutorial by Android Authority for some of the basic functionality, such as setting up the app drawer. But all of the logic for launching and editing favorited apps is entirely my own and the swipe-based tile concept was totally original as well.

The majority of the Java code I wrote is in [this](/app/src/main/java/com/example/launchertest1) directory, and all of the XML is [here](/app/src/main/res/layout).

This was my first time seriously coding in the Android Environment, so it was a big undertaking, but I learned a ton. Plus I'm really glad to have an organized homescreen for once.
